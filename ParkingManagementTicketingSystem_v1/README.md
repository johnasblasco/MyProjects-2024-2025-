The researchers will propose a Parking Management Ticketing System, a
web-based system intended to be used exclusively by the sole client of this project to
enhance parking experience and secure the funds from daily transactions. It was designed
to manage the parking history with details including the time-in/out, kind of vehicle
[2/3/4-wheeler], and how long they stay, as the parking fee may increase based on the
management’s parking rules and regulations.

The system has a login feature to keep its exclusive use only for the staff of the
facility management. It is designed to provide security and protection, and to prevent
outsiders from being able to access the data. Only the staff are allowed to use an account
to maintain a secured and safe network.
As a driver enters the parking lot, there are certain policies that are expected to be
followed. These rules and penalties are created to ensure cooperation and good discipline
among the drivers. The rules are as follows:


Parking Duration: Parishioners are allowed to park with no time limit as long as they
leave at the end of the day since overnight parking is not allowed.
- Parking Vehicle Pricing
- PHP 15 for 2-wheeler vehicles.
- PHP 20 for 3-4 wheeler vehicles.
Designated Parking Areas: Vehicles must be parked only in designated spaces. The
parking lot has been divided for 2-3 wheelers and 4-wheelers.
Speed Limits: A low speed limit (e.g., 10 km/h) within the parking lot is enforced to
ensure safety.
Cleanliness: Drivers must dispose of trash properly, and littering is prohibited.
Security: The church is not responsible for lost or stolen items; drivers should not leave
valuables in plain sight.
Noise Control: Drivers are expected to keep noise levels to a minimum to maintain a
peaceful environment, as excessive noise can disrupt the church during mass.
Respect for Church Property: Vandalism or any damage to church property, including
the parking lot, is strictly prohibited and may result in fines or further action.
These additional charges and penalties help ensure that the parking lot is used
fairly and safely, maintaining its availability for all churchgoers.
The system’s features are designed to satisfy the client’s requirements, as well as
to reach and obtain the general and specific objectives of this study. This project consists
of the following features:

1. Parking Management: 
The main system that contains the program handles most of the processes,
including indexing the parking lot spaces available, tallying time per vehicle, controlling
the printing system, displaying information on the screen and other key functionalities.
The ticket printer that prints out stubs or tickets for the users to take and keep,
containing the details such as [time-in, possible time-out, additional charge when
overstaying, and what kind of vehicle: 2/3/4-wheeled vehicle.]
As the web-based system is designed to benefit the parking attendants of the
client, it does have some limitations. One significant limitation is the inability to integrate
automated parking management. While the researchers aimed to fully automate the
system, achieving this within the given timeframe was not feasible. However, this feature
could be considered for future enhancements. Another significant limitation is the
web-based system's reliance on a stable power supply and internet connection. Without
power or internet, the system cannot function, causing downtime and disruption.
Another feature that cannot be added to the system is a visual map. Aside from
the fact that it is unachievable in terms of the given time period, it requires road surface
markings, which may be quite expensive regarding enhancement. On the contrary, the
road surface markings are unnecessary if sensors are integrated into the system. However,
the researchers may consider this feature in future upgrades.
