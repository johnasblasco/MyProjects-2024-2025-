2.1. Plate Number Recognition: The great feature is the use of Plate Number
Recognition (PNR), which is enhanced Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) technology that can capture and record the plate numbers of
vehicles entering and leaving the parking lot. No more manual entry,

thereby reducing the possibilities of error and speeding up the process. To
capture the vehicle's number plate along with the minute when the vehicle
enters or leaves, this information is then linked to the respective ticket and
parking record. It all flows nicely, fast and securely to both users and
admins.

system, It contains a money tracker that allows the user— attendee or
admin to check today’s earnings. The admin is allowed to filter it for
specific dates when they need to verify things.

OCR recognizes a plate number, which adds multiple choices when
choosing what type of vehicle will enter the parking lot. It can be divided
into two categories: 2/3-wheeler vehicles and 4-wheeler vehicles for larger
ones.

2.4. Tracking of Available Space. The tracker of the parking system of how
many cars are occupying the slots and what type of slots are vacant and
ready to use. The attendees won't need to go out from their booths to
check available slots.

reports section for the admin. This contains all the necessary information
on the application. The admin can print out the data from the web app
including the Account list, Vehicle list, and Earnings list. From there, all
